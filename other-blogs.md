There are a bunch of other blogs people have made/kept for their bottom surgery recoveries, and I thought it would be useful to keep a list here so they're easy to find all in one place. This does not have to be only metoidioplasty - I named this site Meta Log since that's my surgery and this is primarily my own blog, but this page can be any bottom surgeries. I'm also happy to add individual pages to store people's writing and/or photos, if they don't want to make their own blog. I'm currently working on getting permission from folks to link their blogs here, so for now, here are two examples of what it would look like:

- [Meta w/ Meltzer](https://themeltzerclinic.com/ftm-surgeries-procedures/) - this is a link to Meltzer's site, just as an example of what it would look like to link to another blog here
{% for local_blog in site.other_local_blogs %}
- [{{local_blog.title}}]({{local_blog.url}}) - this is an example page to show what it would look like if someone wanted to submit their own writing (with or without photos) to be hosted here on this site, so they don't have to create their own wordpress or blogger site
{% endfor %}

## Submission Info

If you would like your own external blog linked here, please just share the link with me, and I'll add it to the list above. Please note: I won't link to blogs where the author hasn't given me permission to share it here, because I want to respect that some people only share their blog link with a specific population, e.g. a private Facebook group where they've vetted the members - i.e. please don't send me a link to someone else's blog other than your own.

If you would like to host your own page about your experience here because you don't want to deal with creating your own blog, I'm happy to add it for you. You can [email me](mailto:cheunghei.industries@gmail.com) your text (with or without pictures), along with the name/pseudonym you want it under, and I will put it up for you here as your own page/entry.

### Privacy

I am firmly committed to keeping any submissions completely anonymous unless the author makes it clear they want to share their name, but if you prefer to email me your submission anonymously from a friend's email account, that is also totally fine.

I will only post the text/images shared with me, and under the name you specify in the email body - please make that very clear, e.g. "Pseudonym: Mike" or "Name: Jesse", or I will just set it to anonymous.

### Requirements

Essentially... none, other than submitting via email like I described above. It's your page. You can go into whatever level of detail you want and structure it how you want. If you want photos embedded, please embed them in the text within the body of the email where they belong, or otherwise make it clear, e.g.:

```markdown

Had surgery! Here's what my dressings looked like that afternoon:

That evening, I went to sleep around 9.

...etc.

Feel free to email me with any questions, too!
