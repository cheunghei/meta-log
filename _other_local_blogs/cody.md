title: Cody - simple release with Dr. Ng in 2021

An example page to show what it might look like for someone to host their own blog here under a fake name. You can [email me](mailto:cheunghei.industries@gmail.com) your text and pictures, along with the name/pseudonym you want it under, and I will put it up for you here as your own page/entry.

### Privacy

I am firmly committed to keeping any submissions completely anonymous, but if you prefer to email me your submission anonymously from a friend's email account, that is also totally fine. You can also choose to share your real name, if you want to - it's completely up to you!

I will only post the text/images shared with me, and under the name you specify in the email body - please make that very clear, e.g. "Pseudonym: Mike" or "Name: Jesse", or I will just set it to anonymous.

### Requirements

Essentially... none, other than submitting via email like I described above. It's your page. You can go into whatever level of detail you want and structure it how you want. If you want photos embedded, please embed them in the text within the body of the email where they belong, or otherwise make it clear, e.g.:

```markdown
10/12/2021

Had surgery! Here's what my dressings looked like that afternoon:

That evening, I went to sleep around 9.

...etc.
```

Photos can be embedded anywhere in the text, like this:

...with more text below, etc.
