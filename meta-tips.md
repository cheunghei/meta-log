A compilation of the main things I'd recommend for the meta process/recovery so they're all in one place, rather than scattered throughout each individual post... with the caveat that everyone's body is different, and you should listen to your body + your surgeon!

#### Catheter

- Try to switch to the flip flow valve from the bag as soon as you can. Your experience might be different, but for me, the valve made a HUGE difference - it made my bladder way happier (could hold urine and keep the balloon inside more cushioned from the bladder walls) AND made me a lot more mobile and independent, which helped emotionally.
- Experiment with tube securement. My surgeon's clinical staff recommended just tucking the flip flow valve tubing into my underwear, which worked fine, but I found it a lot more comfortable to secure it using the stat lock they'd placed on my thigh so the tube was pinned down and couldn't get jostled at all when I moved around. Similarly, it's nice to find a good way for the tubing to sit in your underwear, and can't also make a big difference for bladder comfort.
- Personally I preferred peeing into a cup and then just dumping the pee afterward because it felt cleaner to me than leaning over the toilet from up high with the tube, which made it splatter a lot. I imagine this will be an adjustment with time assuming I start peeing through my penis successfully, but I just didn't want to deal with having to bend over to lift the seat or to wipe drops off the seat afterward.
- The flip flow valve is SLOW, and for me, the pressure of needing to pee with the catheter in was much greater standing than lying down, so don't wait until the last second to get up to pee. I waited too long a few times, and it was really not comfortable getting up from the couch and having my bladder pressure increase a lot from the change in position, making the need to urinate feel way more urgent. In those cases, I'd race to the bathroom (as fast as I could safely walk), but with the valve, it still takes a good 30 seconds or more to feel relief since it lets urine out so slowly.

#### Wound Care

- Invest in at least one but preferably two big packs of gauze (i.e. one pack = 200 squares). You may not need that much, but I personally found it worth the extra $10 or so to have an extra big pack on hand and not feel any stress about running out/using too much. This enabled me to change my gauze frequently, which helped a lot in both things staying clean and dry (good for healing, especially since I had wound separation) but also just to feel better (feeling clean mentally felt better and also feeling like the area was well-padded and well-supported was a lot more comfortable).
- Wash and re-use the mesh underwear. It's nice to get good airflow to your wounds, especially if you're still having drainage and/or any wound separation. The mesh underwear from the surgery center was great, but I only had a few pairs. My partner helped do laundry for me, and I tossed them in and kept using them (they did shrink, but they're easy enough to stretch back out with your hands).
- GET A PERI BOTTLE! It's so worth it. For cleaning all around my incisions, I would fill it with warm soapy water, get into the shower with the water off and gently spray and clean everything with the bottle, rinse and refill the bottle with warm water, rinse everything down there off, and then turn the water on and do the rest of my usual shower things. It was nice having the bottle to get everywhere around there while still remaining gentle (I have a bidet with a hose that can reach to the shower, but I didn't use it because the pressure was too hard). It was also nice to be able to use the bottle in the shower without the water being on because it meant I could prop up my hand mirror to see everything while cleaning without needing the shower curtain (which would block the mirror) or the mirror getting wet and making it hard to see (also, the steam from the shower would quickly have fogged the mirror, which would also make it hard to see anything down there!).

#### Positioning

- I was honestly just too afraid to sit for the first two weeks. Your experience may vary, and I know a lot of people swear by donut pillows or would sit in recliners, but I was just too nervous to pull at my incisions at all, and it didn't feel worth the risk to me. However, you may want to get a donut pillow, airplane neck pillow (preferably with beads rather than foam), or other butt pillow to help keep the tension off. Even if you don't sit early on like me, these still can come in useful weeks later even if the incisions are all healed, because it can remain a bit uncomfortable to otherwise sit in hard chairs or for, e.g., the flight back after your 4-5 weeks in the area if you've travelled for surgery.
- Back-sleeping does not come naturally to me. Luckily I had some practice from my top surgery days, so I knew what pillow configurations helped. I would recommend spending some time BEFORE surgery practicing back sleeping a little bit, trying different pillow setups, etc. to see what works best for you, because you don't want to be testing all of those different re-positionings right after surgery (all of the extra movement, yanking pillows this way and that, etc is not desirable when your wounds are fresh). If you like to sleep totally flat like I sometimes do, I found two folded up sweatshirts, one on either side of my head, helped me feel like my head wouldn't lean too far to either side.
- When riding in the car (the trip back from surgery, to and from post-op appointments, etc), I found sitting on a regular bed pillow with the seat almost fully reclined was super comfortable. Again, you might need to try different pillows to find what suits you, but in general I would say definitely reclining the seat is necessary/useful. For your rides, try to get them to pull somewhere where the passenger door is not exposed to traffic, because you'll want to take your time getting in and out (similar to sitting on the toilet, you don't want to just plop down quickly), and traffic whizzing by the car door or waiting for you to get in/out to pass just adds stress to the situation unnecessarily.

#### Bowel Movements

- STAY ON TOP OF YOUR STOOL SOFTENERS AND LAXATIVE. Don't get cocky and think you'll be the exception. You do not want to add the stress of trying to pass a super hard stool to the already-stressful situation of trying to poop for the first couple of times post-op. That said, don't stress too hard about the actual pooping - it feels ridiculously stressful because the v-nectomy suture line is right up there next to your anus, but realistically your entire perineum is not actually pulling that much while pooping, and it will be fine. Many of us have pooped right after meta before you, and I promise it will be okay. My only main tips there are to sit down onto the toilet as slowly as possible and to do whatever you can to just relax the whole area and let your bowels do the work.
