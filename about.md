This blog is a record of my experience having metoidioplasty (release, scrotoplasty, v-nectomy, and UL) with Dr Chen in 2022. I would like to keep it anonymous to the general public, but am happy to connect with other trans folks reading this who are considering / planning for / have gone through meta! I'm happy to answer any questions or chat about the experience more - reading other people's blogs like this was absolutely the biggest help to me in preparing, and I want to pay it forward. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can email me at [cheunghei.industries@gmail.com](mailto:cheunghei.industries@gmail.com), and I should get back to you within a couple of days. I'm happy to text, Discord, etc. too, but would like to connect over email first so that I can keep this anonymous outside of trans-only spaces.

#### Surgery Timeline

#### Meta Decision

I'm sharing some of my thinking around which surgical route to take here in case it's helpful for other people trying to make a similar decision. I definitely share all of these criteria with the lens of "this is how I personally felt / what was personally important to me", and none of it is intended as a comment on other people's priorities, experiences, or relationships with their own bodies - these are super personal experiences, and I don't want to diminish anyone's experience here, just share my own as it applies only to me.

My priorities for bottom surgery were (CW: dysphoria, talking about natal genitalia):

- Having "external" genitalia - something I could cup in my hand, something that I could feel confident and comfortable internally thinking about and externally describing as a penis and scrotum. (I recognize this is a socialized thing, and is certainly not universally true nor "objectively" true, but within myself, I really struggled with not feeling self-conscious or like a partial imposter when I would describe my genitalia pre-meta as a penis, even though I wanted to.)
- Being able to urinate through the tip of my penis - I would prefer to be able to stand to pee at a urinal / in men's bathrooms, but I was also okay with the possibility that this wouldn't be something meta could give me due to positioning; I was mostly concerned with alleviating the dysphoria of not peeing through my penis, even if I needed to do so sitting or with my pants at my ankles.
- Having "natal" erections - I really enjoyed my current erections and wanted to maintain those.

Ambivalent / middle-of-the-road things:

- Bulge - I wanted to not feel self-conscious about lightweight gym shorts, e.g., very obviously kind of going "up & in" between my legs, but I also didn't want a big bulge. I hoped that meta (especially once I had testicular implants) would be a nice in-between for me of having "the absence of the absence of a bulge" (as I saw someone describe it on Reddit once) without worrying about a big bulge there.
- Ability to have penetrative sex - in a perfect world, I would like to be able to have penetrative sex using my penis, but I also felt strongly that my natal erections play into my sexuality heavily (both solo & partnered), and ultimately felt that was more important to me between the two.

Some things that didn't feel important to me or that I didn't want:

- Larger size - I felt fine having a really small penis, and was very apprehensive at the possibility of having a larger penis there 24/7. When I had tried packers before, having that size and weight there really bothered me, and I leaned towards much smaller packers already, so I knew that a smaller size suited my preferences more. I did like the idea of feeling _something_ there, but the way I saw post-meta people describe the feeling of how their scrotum with implants would move around sounded very appealing to me and like it would satisfy that need for me.
- Scarring - I knew from my top surgery experience (I have keloid scars from it) that I tend to scar more thickly and obviously, and that it makes me self-conscious / self-aware (I still get nervous that literally everyone is clocking me when I take my shirt off in public), so it felt important to me to avoid more scarring if possible. I would have considered accepting it if aspects of phallo felt really important to me, but my other criteria already meshed well with what meta could give me, so I didn't need to think a lot more on this aspect.
