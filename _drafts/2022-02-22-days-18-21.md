## Day 18-19

Urine followed the same pattern - cloudy in the morning, clearer after the morning Bactrim, then cloudy again by dinnertime. On day 19, I had more bladder pain spasms at night again, and decided I needed to call Ursula the following day (Monday).

## Day 20

Called Ursula and gave her the updates. She said I likely needed to switch antibiotics and that I should do a urine analysis at a lab so they could pick the right antibiotic to target whatever specific thing I had brewing in there. Called up my good friend nearby and he said he'd able to drive me, so I made an appointment at a Quest lab for that afternoon, and printed out the order form Ursula emailed to me to bring to the lab.

A mild silver lining of this was that the lab with the most appointments was in Chinatown, so we got some good food and boba afterward (which I had been really missing!).

## Day 21
