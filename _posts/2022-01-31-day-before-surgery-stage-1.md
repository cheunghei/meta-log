title: "Stage 1: Day -1, the day before surgery"
---

Woke up at 10am, started drinking the magnesium citrate at 10:30 - technically this was a little late, since Chen's pre-op instructions say to start at 9 or 10am. I was confused about how fast to drink it, and called Ursula. She told me you want to drink it all as fast as possible, but can take little breaks if your stomach is upset; but the goal is NOT to drink it throughout the day - you want to get it all in as soon as possible. It took me probably 45 minutes to finish the whole thing - it was really intense from the lemon flavoring/acidity and made my stomach a little unhappy. About an hour later, I started seeing the effects. The next few hours were maybe 3-5 big poops, progressively more watery (by the third it was mostly just liquid).

In the afternoon and evening, I had intermittent smaller ones. Every time I'd drink something (water, broth, etc), it would almost immediately just run right through me. I did a strategically-timed walk outside in the afternoon by leaving right after visiting the bathroom and making sure not to drink anything until I returned home.

I think you're allowed to eat normally during this process, but I decided to just do a liquid diet anyway, because I 1) wanted to optimize the post-op poop situation as much as possible, and 2) thought it seemed like just an un-fun time, to be eating while also essentially having frequent diarrhea. I was definitely hungry as a result though, especially in the evening. Looking back, I'd probably do it more middle-of-the-road, i.e. having some yogurt, a banana, etc - a few easy & soft but solid foods.

I'd highly recommend starting and finishing the magnesium citrate earlier â€“ like start at 8am and try to finish by 8:30am if possible. I definitely didn't get everything out by the time of surgery, and it was not fun feeling like I had to clench my butt all the time right after surgery due to still having a bit of watery poop in there. It also made it so that I had intense bloating the first two days since I was struggling to pass gas.

Otherwise, this day was just prep. I moved some clothes around in my drawers so the things I knew I'd want in the first couple of weeks were higher up, got the "pee pads" set out and ready, put my big pack of gauze on the bathroom counter in easy reach, etc.
