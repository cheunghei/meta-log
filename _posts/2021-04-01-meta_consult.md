title: Pre-Meta Consult with Dr. Chen
---

I had my consult with Dr Chen in April of 2021, which was about six months after I first got in touch with his office to schedule it. This was obviously during COVID, so it was completely virtual. I've heard of other people being asked or asking to submit photos, but this didn't happen for me, so we just talked about my anatomy without looking at it. He did a slideshow about the overall meta procedure (it can be a little gory, so be prepared for that) and reviewing different photos pre- and post-op of different people, discussing how their different pre-op anatomy translated into how things looked differently post-op, to help give me a sense of how my own anatomy might translate into my outcomes.

Overall, I already knew going in that I was definitely not an "ideal candidate", because everything for me is quite low down, and while I have pretty average growth, I also have a super padded mons and very "prominent upper m*jora folds" (as he describes them), which obscure my penis quite a bit. Luckily I had my expectations set already from having read other people's blogs, so I knew that stage 1 was not going to make a huge visual difference and that stage 2 (implants with monsplasty and upper m. reduction) would help rearrange things a bit to make my penis more prominent and sit a little higher up.

We also talked super briefly about my surgical goals (see more on the "About" page) - particularly, that I was okay with not being able to pee through my fly as long as I could pee out of my penis.

At the end, he asked if I was considering other surgeons, which I wasn't, and then we discussed dates. He offered me a date about nine months later, and I confirmed, so I was very happy to end the consult with a date for stage 1 already set!
