## Day 10

Chill day. Had come to emotionally accept the wound separation more, so was less stressed about that and no longer anxiously checking it every few hours. I had gotten some good advice from other folks who had wound separation the night before on the bottom surgery Discord server. They reiterated the same wound care info from Dr Chen (if wet, keep dry and use just plain gauze; if wet, use gauze with ointment - medihoney, aquaphor, etc.), but what was most helpful for me was the emotional advice. They talked about not checking the healing progress too often (once every day or two is all you really need), taking photos so you can really see the progress over the weeks, and just accepting this as part of your own journey and not obsessing about whether you could have prevented it or what caused it. I definitely took these things to heart, and it made me feel a lot better and be able to lean in to resting and doing fun recovery things moving forward. I had a fun time with a friend, who brought Cubano sandwiches for us to eat together, and we played some cards. I also used a little of my weed tincture, and watched a movie I'd been wanting to see for a while. All in all a good day, and the lack of stressing and checking on my wounds too often definitely made things better. They also just physically felt better, now that I was into a routine of changing my gauze frequently enough but also not poking at them too often anymore.
