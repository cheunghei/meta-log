## Day 1

Way less foggy, this day. Finally relaxed enough to get the watery poop out that evening, but it wasn't a ton. Still needed my partner's help in and out of bed/the couch (they would help push my back + pull me up by my hand/arm and also lift the catheter bag for me). Standing/walking didn't feel great - I could feel pressure all over the surgery area. It wasn't terribly painful, but it was enough that I didn't want to stand around at all if possible. I think the surgery center and Ursula both called this day to check on me as well, which was nice for any questions I hadn't thought of previously.

## Day 2

At first, basically the same as yesterday, except walking was a little easier, but that all changed after my first post-op appointment in the afternoon. Ursula swapped out the bag for the flip-flow valve, and it was INSTANT relief. The bag's jostling had really been wearing on me. I also had seen other people mention that keeping their bladder full helped alleviate some of the discomfort from the balloon of the catheter by keeping it from touching the walls of the bladder too much, and this wasn't really possible with the bag, because it would just drain out immediately. With the flip-flow valve, I could drink and retain the liquid in my bladder to help "pad" the balloon. The ride back home with it on was definitely more comfortable than the one there with the bag (especially going over bumps). I also was able to get up by myself from then on, by kind of crab shimmying to the edge of the bed or couch and then turning over slightly and pushing with my arms behind me while rotating slightly on my butt.

Also took my first shower this evening, which was a little stressful to navigate but felt good.

## Day 3

This felt like a turning point for me - first night's sleep without the bag, first day of being able to get up myself and walk more comfortably (in general + without the bag jostling with each step). I made breakfast for my partner and me this morning, and that felt like a nice little taste of my usual routine. Also had my first real poop (not the watery remnants from the magnesium citrate), and that was pretty fine. A little blood from the very end of my perineum/v-nectomy sutures near the anus, but nothing alarming and stopped pretty much instantly.
